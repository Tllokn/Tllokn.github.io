            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              I'm Luzhe Sun,a student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. This summer I am working on robotics research with Professor Matthew Walter at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              I studied at the School of Information Science at Xiamen University as an undergraduate,
              where I conducted research on graph theory with Professor <a href="https://informatics.xmu.edu.cn/info/1019/15293.htm">Zhihong Zhang</a>.
              I worked with Xing Ai to complete a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05158">paper</a> on quantum neural networks for graph
              classification under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/erh">Edwin Hancock</a>.
              This has greatly increased my interest in graph theory and machine learning.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              In the summer of 2020, I spent seven months with Professor <a href="https://www.math.purdue.edu/~lin491/">Guang Lin</a>
              at Purdue University learning about multi-fidelity data prediction and building the <a href="https://github.com/Tllokn/Deep-Multi-Fidelity-Gaussian-Process-Prediction">Deep Multi-Fidelity Gaussian Process
              Prediction framework</a>.
            </p>

             <p class="text">
              In my free time I really enjoy photography and painting Chinese paintings, so if you're interested I can
               teach you how to get started. I also play the erhu, but not as distinguished as painting.

                I use a diffusion model to correct for user input, thus achieving shared-autonomy.
                user intent is preserved by controlling the number of diffusion steps in the diffusion model.
                The experiment is successful on the LunarLander and Block Push environment. The code is currently not publicly available.

                I used the diffusion model to predict the trajectory of the manipulator, and at the same time explored
                the properties of the diffusion model. The diffusion model can do trajectory stitching,
                and the diffusion model can also perform conditional sampling to achieve trajectory inpainting.
                The experiment was simulated in Maze2D and Ravens environment.

                In daily life, we often encounter situations where it is difficult to
                obtain high-fidelity data during the training phase of some data
                predictions, such as changes in the earth’s atmosphere and heat
                conduction data. But for these experiments, we can use artificially
                simulated physical models to obtain a large amount of data. But these
                artificially simulated data often have a gap with the real situation,
                that is, low-fidelity data. How to train a model with a large number
                of low-fidelity data obtained by simulation combined with very few high-precision
                high-fidelity data so that the model has a high correct rate of prediction for
                high-fidelity data has become a problem worthy of research.

                Quantum machine learning is a fast emerging field that aims to tackle
                machine learning using quantum algorithms and quantum computing.
                We propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for graph-structured data, which we refer to as the
                Decompositional Quantum Graph Neural Network (DQGNN).
                DQGNN implements the GNN theoretical framework using the tensor product and unity
                matrices representation, which greatly reduces the number of model parameters required.

                With the economic development and the improvement of living standards, people's demand for spiritual culture has further increased.
                Tourism has become people's basic way of life and one of the best choices for people to use leisure time. In recent years, the booming
                transnational free travel has gradually entered the scope of public acceptance. The accompanying problem is that there are inconveniences in tourism,
                accommodation consumption and other fields due to the relationship of language. The "Self-Travel Assistant" APP is designed based on this situation
                and is an auxiliary application for tourists from China and Japan to travel independently. Using modern AI technology to assist tourists,
                provide and recommend information on local attractions, restaurants, accommodation, transportation, etc.
